# Contributing

**Thanks!** If you took interest in contributing, you're already awesome. Even more so now that you came to read these guidelines. In fact, reading through Turbine's code and documents is a free audit that every community member actively donate to the project and is much appreciated.

**Why?** There should be plenty of work to do, which is why organization is key. Hopefully this short read will boost the community potential to achieve more and faster. Infrastructure and Data related technology tends to have slow development and adoption, but we want to change this.

**How?** You can immediately contribute by participating in any of the [current issues](https://github.com/villasv/turbine/issues), be it by simply giving your opinion in the discussion or actively solving a problem. All forms of community interaction are welcomed contributions, so writing blog posts and tutorials or making citations at presentations and workshops are appreciated too.

**But...** It would be best if everyone tried keep chatty discussions out of the issue tracker, as well as support questions. If you want to ask for help, give general feedback or engage in lengthy conversations, the best channel is our [chat room](https://gitter.im/airflow-turbine/Lobby).
